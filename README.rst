Real-time data acquisition from a microcontroller over a serial port.

This Python package facilitates data acquisition in real time from a
microcontroller (MCU). After establishing a connection to the MCU, data
are acquired from an arbitrary number of channels (signals), displayed,
and (optionally) saved to disc in EDF format.
